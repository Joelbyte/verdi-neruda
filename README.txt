3. INSTALLATION AND RUNNING

Verdi Neruda requires Logtalk 2.x.

* Fetch the latest source code, either as an archive or from the git repository,
  and extract it to a directory of your choice.
* Start Logtalk from that directory.
* Type {loader}. (Including '.').
* If everything went according to the plan you should be greeted by the welcoming message.

4. EXAMPLES 
Follow the previous instructions to get everything up and
running. First we're going to run some predefined programs in the
included databases. Begin by typing 'databases.'  from the shell -
this should print a list of the currently loaded databases. The demo
database 'demodb' should be included in the list. Next type
'listing(demodb).' to print the contents of the database. The output
should look something like:

append([], $VAR(0), $VAR(0)) <- true.  append([$VAR(0)|$VAR(1)],
	  $VAR(2), [$VAR(0)|$VAR(3)]) <- append($VAR(1), $VAR(2),
	  $VAR(3)).  .  .  .

Which means that the append/3 program is loaded and ready for
action. Next we need to decide which interpreter to use. Fortunately
the shell does not leave much to the imagination - as might be
expected the 'interpreters.' command prints the currently loaded
interpreters. The list should look like:

dfs_interpreter bfs_interpreter iddfs_interpreter($VAR(0))
bup_interpreter a_star_interpreter($VAR(1))

$VAR(0) means that the interpreter is a parametric object and that
additional information is needed in order to run it. The
iddfs-interpreter needs to know the increment and the A*-interpreter
needs to know what weight should be used when calculating the cost of
nodes. To start with let's use the dfs-interpreter and do something
exciting, namely appending two lists!

    prove(dfs_interpreter, append([a,b], [c,d], Xs), demodb).

The prove command takes three arguments. The first is a interpreter,
the second the goal that shall be proved and the last the database
that the clauses are derived from.

To accomplish the same thing with the iddfs-interpreter with an
increment of 1 we need only type

   prove(iddfs_interpreter(1), append([a,b], [c,d], Xs), demodb).

The shell also has support for counting logical inferences. To compare
the dfs- and iddfs-interpreter with the append program we could write:

benchmark(dfs_interpreter, append([a,b,c,d],[e,f], Xs), demodb).  ->
dfs_interpreter inferences: 5

benchmark(iddfs_interpreter(1), append([a,b,c,d],[e,f], Xs), demodb).
-> iddfs_interpreter(1) inferences: 15

For more information regarding the built in shell commands consult the
'help.' command.
